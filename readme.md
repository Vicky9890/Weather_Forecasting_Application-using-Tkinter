This application is a simple weather forecasting tool built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to input a location and obtain current weather information from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Description

This Weather Forecasting Application, developed in Python using Tkinter, provides a user-friendly platform for retrieving real-time weather forecasts. With a sleek interface, users can input their desired location within India as well as International location also and obtain current weather information sourced from the OpenWeatherMap API. The application displays crucial weather details such as temperature, climate, and atmospheric pressure, simplifying access to accurate weather updates. Offering an intuitive experience, this tool streamlines the process of accessing precise weather data, ensuring users stay informed about the latest weather conditions effortlessly.

## Tkinter

Tkinter is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for Python. It comes bundled with most Python installations, making it easily accessible for creating desktop applications with graphical elements. Tkinter provides a set of tools and widgets to build user interfaces, enabling developers to design windows, dialogs, buttons, menus, and other GUI components.

## OpenWeatherMap API

The OpenWeatherMap API is a service that provides access to weather data from various locations worldwide. It offers current weather information, forecasts, historical weather data, and more. Developers use this API to integrate weather-related functionalities into their applications, websites, or services.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Utilizes Tkinter for a straightforward graphical user interface (GUI).

- **Weather Data Retrieval:** Fetches current weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API based on the selected location.

- **Display of Weather Information:** Shows weather conditions, description, temperature (in Celsius), and atmospheric pressure.

## Requirements

- Python

To run the code, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- Tkinter
- requests

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
   pip install requests
```
Just run [weather_forcasting_Application.py](https://github.com/Vicky9890/Weather_Forecasting_Application_using_Tkinter/blob/master/weather_forcasting_Application.py) for Weather casting related to India as well as other Countries also.

## Instructions:

- Upon running the application, a GUI window will open.
- Select a state or union territory of India from the dropdown menu or International country or you can type also.
- Click the "Done" button to retrieve weather information.
- Weather details such as climate, description, temperature, and pressure will be displayed.

## API Used

This application leverages the OpenWeatherMap API, retrieving real-time weather data for user-selected Indian states or union territories or International country. It dynamically fetches and displays current weather details, offering accurate forecasts based on the chosen location within India.
