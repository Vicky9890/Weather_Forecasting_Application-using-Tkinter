## Tkinter

Tkinter is the standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) library for Python. It comes bundled with most Python installations, making it easily accessible for creating desktop applications with graphical elements. Tkinter provides a set of tools and widgets to build user interfaces, enabling developers to design windows, dialogs, buttons, menus, and other GUI components.

## OpenWeatherMap API

The OpenWeatherMap API is a service that provides access to weather data from various locations worldwide. It offers current weather information, forecasts, historical weather data, and more. Developers use this API to integrate weather-related functionalities into their applications, websites, or services.
